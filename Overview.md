# Overview
## Introduction
This guide is intended primarily for developers. It is a supplement to our [technical documentation](https://developers.booking.com/api/technical.html), which should be consulted for more detailed information on all endpoints. However, we recommend that you read this documentation before you look at the technical documentation. 

## Use
You create tasks that a patient performs for a particular condition. These tasks can then be monitored by the patient's physician. For example, for condition insomnia, you create tasks for the patient to enter hours of sleep, average heart rate, and type of sleep every day. 

Note that you can define logic in your mobile app so that all of this information is captured from the patient's health device such as activity trackers. This helps the patient to avoid manually entering data into your app. 

## Prerequisites
