# About SAP Health for Patient Engagement

SAP Health for Patient Engagement is a cloud solution that enables physicians to monitor a patient's health for a specific condition. For example, if a patient has condition insomnia, the physician can monitor the patient's sleep and heart rate. The ability to constantly monitor a patient's health helps the physician in taking the right course of action at the right time. 

The solution provides a user interface for physicians to monitor the health of patients, and a set of APIs that you can use in your patient's mobile app to send health information such as average heart rate to the physician.
